          <h1>Frontend developer and graphic designer</h1>
          <p>My name is Charlotte Flygare, I am 36 years old and live in Gr√∂ndal in Stockholm with my husband and daugther.
          Currently I work as a graphic designer at the design- and advertising agency FamiljenPangea. There I do
          everything from branding to designing websites. Besides art, form and fashion my newest interest is to code in Atom,
          especially in React. I love problemsolving but mostly details in making websites</p>
